<h1> Asteroids Java, Reverse Engineering </h1>

<p>This is a Project done in Java (IDE: Netbeans), where we had a simple Asteroids code and we had to do a 
"Reverse Engineering" and make the game look better. Somethings were done to the code as: Added points, life, music, sound. 
Also I've made some changes to the colors, ship, etc</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
